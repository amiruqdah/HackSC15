## About

This is a minimal hyper cube maze game made by Lucas Tecot and Amir Uqdah in 36 hours. A lot of emphasis was put on establishing feel and personality into the game.
The game is also HFT Integrated.

### Special Thanks

Special Thanks to Jessica Zhou (for encouragement and support) and Gemma Buosoni's artistic skills and conversation on how to approach 
procedurally generating the maps.
